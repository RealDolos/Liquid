  <h1>Liquid(Filth)</h1>
  <p><strong>Liquid</strong> is the founder of the vola YN subgroup, a steroid abuser with raisin testicles and generally a bad dude.</p>
  <p>When he is not recording camgirls, he jerks off in <a href="https://volafile.io/r/BEEPi">#BEEPi</a>.</p>
  <p><strong>Liquid</strong> is also what is known as a <em>never-mod</em>, a person that will never become a mod, ever. This is due to multiple reasons, including:<ul>
    <li>Mental retardation due to drug abuse</li>
    <li>Questionable morals when it comes to underage content</li>
    <li>Being constantly banned because of DMCA abuses</li>
    <li>Being from a small island with much incest</li>
    <li>Because first <span>Rogue</span> and then <b>MercWMouth</b> are more suited to be mods, believe it or not</li>
    <li>Did we mention that pedo thing?</li>
  </ul></p>
